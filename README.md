### 1. Purpose
* This repository is meant to showcase the analysis I performed during master's thesis.
* The subject of this thesis was "What factors influence the choice of elective courses of a European business school?"
* Due to the sensitive nature of the data used within this analysis, the notebooks are provided without the data sources.

### 2. Usage
* The notebooks showing the analysis performed are located in the jupyter-notebooks folder.
* This repository is intended to be "read-only".
* The notebooks are not supposed to be downloaded. They will not work if run as the data sources are not included in the repository.
