### 1. Purpose
* This repository is intended to showcase the analysis I performed during my end of study project.
* The subject of this project was "What factors influence the choice of elective courses of a European business school?"
* Due to the sensitive nature of the data used within this analysis, the notebooks are provided without the data sources.

### 2. Usage
* This repository is intended to be "read-only".
* The notebooks are not supposed to be downloaded. They will not work if run as the data sources are not included in the repository.

### 3. License
* This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License (see LICENSE for more information).
